# MeteorSurveyDemo
A sample of using autoforms and D3 to create a small questionaire with visual feedback in the form of a wheel at the end

For proper functionality, I use the challett:meteor-autoform fork as the main autoform package contains a bug that has yet to be fixed.
To use this, replace the folder in packages with the fork.
